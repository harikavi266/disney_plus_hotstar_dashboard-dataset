Dashboard Layout & Visuals

Bar & Line Chart (Center):
Shows IMDb votes (in bar form) alongside a count of languages (as a line) for various actors or titles. This helps compare the popularity of content (via votes) with the number of languages in which it’s available or produced.
Pie Chart / Donut Chart (Top Right):
Labeled “Count of year by director,” indicating it breaks down how many titles or releases are associated with different directors (possibly grouped by release year).
Horizontal Bar Chart (Bottom Left):
“IMDb_rating & country” suggests it displays average IMDb ratings or rating distribution for each country’s content. This can reveal which countries produce the highest-rated content or the range of ratings by region.
Donut Chart (Bottom Middle):
“IMDb_rating & director” indicates the distribution of ratings by director, giving a sense of which directors tend to have higher or lower-rated content.
Numeric KPI Card (Bottom Right):
“total_imdb_voting” showcases the sum of IMDb votes across all content in the dataset, giving a quick reference to overall popularity or user engagement.
Filters (Left Panel):
Type (13+, Not Rated, Passed, PG, R, etc.): This lets users filter content based on its age classification or rating category.
Country (USA, FR, CA, ES, UK, JP, etc.): Enables users to drill down into content from specific countries to see how they perform.
